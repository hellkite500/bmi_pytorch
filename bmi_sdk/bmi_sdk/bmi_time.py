    BMI doesn't have much for specific time implementaiton, but some hints can be found
    in the time funciton docs: https://bmi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#time-functions

    e.g.
    "Model time is always expressed as a floating point value."
    "The start time in BMI is typically defined to be 0.0."
    "If the model doesnâ€™t define an end time, a large number (e.g., the largest floating point number supported on a platform) is typically chosen."
    "A time step is typically a positive value. However, if the model permits it, a negative value can be used (running the model backward)."
